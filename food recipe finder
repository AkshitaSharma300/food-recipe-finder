The Food Recipe Finder is a user-friendly application designed to simplify the process of finding recipes based on available ingredients and dietary preferences. With an easy-to-navigate interface, users can input ingredients they have on hand, select dietary filters, and receive a curated list of recipes tailored to their needs.

The system addresses a common challenge for home cooks and meal planners by providing a solution that reduces food waste and helps with meal inspiration. Key features include ingredient-based search, customizable dietary filters, recipe saving options, and nutritional information for healthier choices. Designed for accessibility, the Food Recipe Finder is compatible with web and mobile platforms, making it an ideal tool for individuals and families looking to maximize their resources while exploring new meal ideas. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate the value of technology in enhancing daily meal preparation, making the process more efficient, enjoyable, and sustainable.
