            <h2>Strawberry Custard</h2>
            <p>In a bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of custard powder with 1/4 cup cold milk until smooth. In a saucepan, heat 2 cups of milk and 1/4 cup sugar over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

Once cool, stir in 1 cup of chopped strawberries. Chill in the refrigerator for an hour, and serve topped with more fresh strawberries or whipped cream</p>

In a serving glass, layer the falooda sev, followed by a layer of the soaked basil seeds. Add 1-2 scoops of rose ice cream or vanilla ice cream on top. Pour in 1/2 cup of chilled milk mixed with 2 tablespoons of rose syrup. You can also add a few tablespoons of cooked vermicelli for extra texture.

                    <h2>Fried Rice</h2>
                    <p>
                        To make fried rice, start by cooking 2 cups of rice and letting it cool completely (day-old rice works best). Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add 1 chopped onion and sauté until translucent. Then, add 1 cup of mixed vegetables (like peas, carrots, and bell peppers) and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes. Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and crack 2 eggs into the other side, scrambling them until cooked through. Mix everything together and add the cooled rice, along with 2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir-fry everything for another 3-5 minutes until heated through. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve hot!

                    <p>
                        To make fritters, start by preparing the batter. In a bowl, combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and your choice of spices (like paprika or cumin) for flavor. Gradually add about 3/4 cup of water to form a thick batter. If you’d like, mix in chopped vegetables (like onions, spinach, or zucchini) or even cooked meat. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, drop spoonfuls of the batter into the oil, frying a few at a time until they turn golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the fritters and drain on paper towels. Serve hot with dipping sauces like chutney or ketchup for a delicious snack!

Meanwhile, prepare the sugar syrup by boiling 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water with a few drops of lemon juice and a pinch of cardamom powder until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let it cool. After resting, divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a marble). Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium heat and fry the balls until golden brown, ensuring they are cooked through. Once fried, soak the hot gulab jamuns in the warm sugar syrup for at least 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped pistachios or almonds if desired!

                    <h2>Pizza</h2>
                    <p>

                        To make pizza, start by mixing 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of instant yeast, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a bowl, then gradually add 3/4 cup of warm water and knead until smooth; cover and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour until doubled in size. Meanwhile, prepare the pizza sauce by sautéing 1 clove of minced garlic in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, adding 1 can of crushed tomatoes (about 400 grams), 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, salt, and pepper, and simmering for 15 minutes. Once the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C), roll out the dough to your desired thickness, place it on a baking sheet or pizza stone, and spread the sauce over the top. Add shredded mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings like pepperoni or bell peppers, then bake for 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Let it cool slightly before slicing and serving for a delicious homemade pizza!

                    <h2>rasmalai</h2>
                    <p>
                        To make rasmalai, start by preparing chenna (fresh cheese) by boiling 1 liter of milk and curdling it with lemon juice or vinegar; strain the curds through a muslin cloth and rinse with cold water to remove the acidic taste. Once cool, knead the chenna until smooth and form small, flat discs. In a pot, boil 4 cups of water with 1 cup of sugar to create a syrup, then gently add the chenna discs and cook for about 10 minutes until they double in size. For the ras, boil another 1 liter of milk in a saucepan, reducing it to half while stirring continuously, then add 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom powder, and a few saffron strands for flavor. Once thickened, remove from heat, let it cool, and add the cooked chenna discs to the milk, soaking for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator. Serve chilled, garnished with slivers of pistachio or almonds, for a delicious and refreshing dessert!

                        To make a red velvet cake, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.
